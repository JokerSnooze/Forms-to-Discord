Dear readers,

This script is used to make "Google Forms" export responses to a discord channel using a webhook.
You will also be able to customize it in some ways for better usage.

How do we set the script up?

First go over to your form and press the "3-dot" button on the top right center.
Now open the script editor and copy past the script in the editor. 
The first line will require you to place the discord wedhook link.
Make sure to fill in everything within "" and not to delete them.

When ready, go to triggers and set up a trigger that starts after a form is send out.

To test it out, make sure that there is already an answer in the form.
